Added a bunch of stuff:
	- New Activity!: added a new home screen activity
		- Completed:
			- Has a home screen image
			- Two buttons, one to join game the other to show replay. Show replay 				doesn't do anything yet.
			- Plays homescreen music in a onResume method
			- Stops the music in a onPause method
			- Will correctly switch to the main tank activy when "join" button is 				clicked
		- Still needs:
			- To check if phone can connect to seerver before starting the main 				activity
	
	- New Tile!: added a new Player tile that is the same as tank but has it's own type. 
	
	- Added to the main activity:	
		- Now has music
			- Plays onResume
			- Releases onPause
		- Now has onlick anotations linked to transparent buttons that will call the 			gamegrid's shoot and move
			- They work great!
			- Move and shoot are no longer called in the grid addapter
		- Cleaned up some of the code 
	
	- Added to TileFactory:
		- Now also takes in a long varaible parameter that should always be the player 			tank id
		- When creating a tank tile, tilefactory will check if the id is equal to the players, 			if it is, make it a player tile instead
	
	- Added to GameGrid:
		- Added a playerDirection byte variable that keeps track on player direction
		- Added a playerAlive boolean variable that represents if the player is found in 			the grid
		- Both are set when grid is parsed. While parsing, it will check if a player tile was 		found. grabs info from it. Otherwise assumes player is dead
		- Turn feature to gameGrid
			- Is called from move if the player is not facing the correct direction
		- Move, turn and shoot all work according to game rules. Will only be carried 			out if the player is alive.
			- No more crashes for trying to move while dead!
	
	- Added to GridAdapter:
		- Now displays the player and enemies differently
		- Cleaned up some of the code
	
	Misc:
	- Fixed the tile's constructors.
		- They weren't parsing the integer value correctly
		- Caused much headache!
	- Added a lot more images
		- Better graphics!
		- Need to orginize the images
