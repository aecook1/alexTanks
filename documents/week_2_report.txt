Week 2 report.
This week we added
	- Tiles for each possible object to be displayed in game
	- A tile factory to make said tiles
	- A game grid, that will contaion a table of tiles and will update the grid when given input 	from the main activity.
	- The main activity will now display the game on screen. It will have a game grid object 	that it can update via button presses. It sends the grid to an image adapter to display in 	the gridview.
	- A gridview to display the different tiles
	- A image adapter class to display images in the gridview

Also, created the images for all of the different objects in the game grid that will need to be shown, except for the missile.
